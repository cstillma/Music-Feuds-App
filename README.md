# Music-Feuds-App

## Description ##
This project is meant to provide a way to organize, track, and showcase the various beefs and diss tracks across any genre of music. As it is meant to serve as a learning tool/resource, the subject matter will be engaged with in a factual, neutral manner. Primarily, this will take the form of a web app in which users can search individual songs or larger feuds and be directed to pages which will describe the history and context at either of those levels, and which will provide interactive timelines and other visualization tools as relevant.
