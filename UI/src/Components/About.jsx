            About the History of Music Feuds Project
          </p>
        <div className="text-container">

            The goal of this project is to serve as a historical resource. In the music industry, feuds have been some of the most important, formative, and interesting moments. 
            Despite this, information about them is often difficult to find, rarely in a cohesive or comprehensive format, and the songs themselves can prove hard to find.
            This project is particularly interested in tracking those feuds in which both parties laid their side down on wax, 
            though one-off diss tracks can also be interesting to study and will be tracked here as well. 
            The end-goal version of the project will enable users to search feuds at the higher level and by individual track, 
            and to be able to read about the history and context at both levels. Tracks will be linked to related tracks, as well as potentially multiple feuds. 
            At the feud level, tracks will be displayed in chronological order, and there will also be a way to view feuds chronologically, i.e., 
            the post-breakup bickering of the Beatles can be seen earlier on the timeline than the Jay-Z/Nas beef. 
            It is also a goal to provide multiple ways to view and analyze the information, ranging from text descriptions to interactive visualizations. 
            Users will also be able to contribute new tracks and feuds, but all information must include references - 
            there will be a review process in which sources must be verified and in this way the project hopes to become the preeminent resource for tracking both
            today's burgeoning pop culture moments, which will become tomorrow's music history. As information is added, the goal is to present it factually and neutrally - 
            we are not declaring winners ourselves, or stating our own opinions or viewpoints; 
            however, if there is sufficient reference to critical or popular consensus regarding who came out on top of a beef,
            it will be included - as will opposing viewpoints if they can be found.
